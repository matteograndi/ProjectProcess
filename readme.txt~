I write thi program with the exam of the Operation Systems

I have some process that communicate between themselves using the fifo

and I use a process that clone themself in more child


HOW TO USE

You need to open 3 terminal

in the fisrt terminal you must run the ./tower enter process
in the second terminal you must run the ./tower exit process
in the third terminal you mus run the ./generator process

to avoid writing by hand the data of the generator process you can run that process with the parameter car1.txt or car2.txt
